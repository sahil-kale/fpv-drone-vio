\subsection{Drone Pose Estimation}
The drone pose estimation from the IMU is required to be accurate for the purposes of the VIO algorithm. Evaluation of the Madgwick filter was performed by comparing the ground-truth pose of the drone to the pose estimated by the Madgwick filter for a validation dataset. The results of the evaluation are shown in Figure \ref{fig:madgwick_results}.

\end{figure}

The results show that the Madgwick filter is able to estimate the pose of the drone with a high degree of accuracy (RMSE (Roll, Pitch, Yaw) - rad: [0.0198 0.0160 0.0425]) in real-time, making it suitable for use in the VIO algorithm.
