\subsection{Drone Pose Estimation}
The drone pose estimation from the IMU is required to be accurate for the purposes of the VIO algorithm. Evaluation of the Madgwick filter was performed by comparing the ground-truth pose of the drone to the pose estimated by the Madgwick filter for the validation dataset. The results of the evaluation are plotted using matplotlib, and are shown in Figure \ref{fig:madgwick_results}.

\end{figure}

The results show that the Madgwick filter is able to estimate the pose of the drone with a high degree of accuracy (RMSE (Roll, Pitch, Yaw): [0.024 0.016 0.040] rad) in real-time, making it suitable for use in the VIO algorithm.
